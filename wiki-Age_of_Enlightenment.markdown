The **Age of Enlightenment** (or simply the **Enlightenment** or **Age of Reason**) 
was a [cultural movement][52] of intellectuals in 18th century Europe and the 
American colonies. Its purpose was to reform society using reason (rather than 
tradition, faith and revelation) and advance knowledge through science. It 
promoted science and intellectual interchange and opposed superstition,[[1]][53] 
intolerance and some abuses by church and state.

Originating about 1650 to 1700, it was sparked by philosophers [Baruch Spinoza][54] 
(1632–1677), [John Locke][55] (1632–1704), [Pierre Bayle][56] (1647–1706), 
physicist [Isaac Newton][57] (1643–1727), and philosopher [Voltaire][58] (1694–1778). 
Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered figures and even attempted to apply 
their ideas of government in what was known as [Enlightened Despotism][59]. 
The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790–1800, after which the emphasis 
on reason gave way to [Romanticism][60]'s emphasis on emotion and a [Counter-Enlightenment][61] 
gained force.[[2]][62]

In France, Enlightenment was based in the [salons][63] and culminated in the 
great _[Encyclopédie][64]_ (1751–72) edited by [Denis Diderot][65] (1713–1784) 
with contributions by hundreds of leading [philosophes][66] (intellectuals) 
such as [Voltaire][58] (1694–1778), [Rousseau][67] (1712–1778) and [Montesquieu][68] 
(1689–1755). Some 25,000 copies of the 35 volume set were sold, half of them 
outside France. The new intellectual forces spread to urban centres across 
Europe, notably England, Scotland, the German states, the Netherlands, Russia, 
Italy, Austria, and Spain, then [jumped the Atlantic into the European colonies][69], 
where it influenced [Benjamin Franklin][70] and [Thomas Jefferson][71], among 
many others, and played a major role in the [American Revolution][72]. The 
political ideals of the Enlightenment influenced the [American Declaration 
of Independence][73], the [United States Bill of Rights][74], the French [Declaration 
of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen][75], and the Polish–Lithuanian [Constitution 
of May 3, 1791][76].[[3]][77]

## 
[[edit][115]] Use of the term

The term 'Enlightenment' did not come into use in English until the mid-18th 
century,[[4]][116] with particular reference to French philosophy, as the equivalent 
of the French term 'Lumières' (used first by Dubos 1733 and already well established 
by 1751). From [Immanuel Kant][117]'s 1784 essay "Beantwortung der Frage: Was 
ist Aufklärung?" ("[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?][118]") 
the German term became 'Aufklärung'.

"For Kant, Enlightenment was mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation 
of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance and error."[[5]][119] 
According to historian [Roy Porter][120], the thesis of the liberation of the 
human mind from the dogmatic state of ignorance that he argues was prevalent 
at the time is the epitome of what the age of enlightenment was trying to capture. 
According to [Bertrand Russell][121], however, the enlightenment was a phase 
in a progressive development, which began in antiquity, and that reason and 
challenges to the established order were constant ideals throughout that time.[[6]][122] 

Russell argues that the enlightenment was ultimately born out of the Protestant 
reaction against the Catholic [counter-reformation][123], when the philosophical 
views of the past two centuries crystallized into a coherent world view. He 
argues that many of the philosophical views, such as affinity for democracy 
against monarchy, originated among Protestants in the early 16th century to 
justify their desire to break away from the pope and the Catholic Church. Though 
many of these philosophical ideals were picked up by Catholics, Russell argues, 
by the 18th century the Enlightenment was the principal manifestation of the 
schism that began with Martin Luther.[[6]][122]

Chartier (1991) argues that the Enlightenment was only invented after the fact 
for a political goal. He claims the leaders of the [French Revolution][124] 
created an Enlightenment canon of basic text, by selecting certain authors 
and identifying them with The Enlightenment in order to legitimize their republican 
political agenda.[[7]][125]

Historian [Jonathan Israel][126] dismisses the post-modern interpretation of 
the Enlightenment and the attempts of modern historians to link social and 
economical reasons for the revolutionary aspect of the period. He instead focuses 
on the history of ideas in the period from 1650 to the end of the 18th century, 
and claims that it was the ideas themselves that caused the change that eventually 
led to the revolutions of the later half of the 18th century and the early 
19th century.[[8]][127] Israel argues that until the 1650s Western civilization 
"was based on a largely shared core of faith, tradition and authority".[[9]][128] 

Up until this date most intellectual debates revolved around "confessional" 
- that is Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist), or Anglican issues", and 
the main aim of these debates was to establish which bloc of faith ought to 
have the "monopoly of truth and a God-given title to authority".[[10]][129] 
After this date everything thus previously rooted in tradition was questioned 
and often replaced by new concepts in the light of philosophical reason. After 
the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century a "general 
process of rationalization and secularization set in which rapidly overthrew 
theology's age-old hegemony in the world of study", and thus confessional disputes 
were reduced to a secondary status in favor of the "escalating contest between 
faith and incredulity".[[10]][129]

This period saw the shaping of two distinct lines of enlightenment thought:[[11]][130][[12]][131] 
Firstly the _radical enlightenment_, largely inspired by the one-substance 
philosophy of [Spinoza][132], which in its political form adhered to: "democracy; 
racial and sexual equality; individual liberty of lifestyle; full freedom of 
thought, expression, and the press; eradication of religious authority from 
the legislative process and education; and full separation of church and state".[[13]][133] 

Secondly the _moderate enlightenment_, which in a number of different philosophical 
systems, like those in the writings of [Descartes][134], [John Locke][55], 
[Isaac Newton][57] or [Christian Wolff][135], expressed some support for critical 
review and renewal of the old modes of thought, but in other parts sought reform 
and accommodation with the old systems of power and faith.[[14]][136] These 
two lines of thought were again met by the conservative Counter-Enlightenment, 
encompassing those thinkers who held on to the traditional belief-based systems 
of thought.

### 
[[edit][137]] Time span

There is little consensus on the precise beginning of the age of Enlightenment; 
the beginning of the 18th century (1701) or the middle of the 17th century 
(1650) are often used as an approximate starting point.[[15]][138] If taken 
back to the mid-17th century, the Enlightenment would trace its origins to 
[Descartes][139]' _[Discourse on Method][140]_, published in 1637. Others define 
the Enlightenment as beginning in Britain's [Glorious Revolution][141] of 1688 
or with the publication of [Isaac Newton][57]'s _[Principia Mathematica][142]_ 
in 1687. [Jonathan Israel][126] argues, "after 1650, everything, no matter 
how fundamental or deeply rooted, was questioned in the light of philosophic 
reason".[[16]][143] Israel makes the detailed case that, from 1650 to 1750, 
Spinoza was "the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, 
received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist 
and nonabsolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority."[[17]][144] 

As to its end, most scholars use the last years of the century – often choosing 
the [French Revolution][124] of 1789 or the beginning of the [Napoleonic Wars][145] 
(1804 – 15) as a convenient point in time with which to date the end of the 
Enlightenment.[[18]][146]

[[edit][147]] National variations

[![][148]][149]

[![][150]][149]

 Europe at the beginning of the [War of the Spanish Succession][151], 1700.

The Enlightenment operated in most countries, but often with a specific local 
emphasis. For example in France it became associated with anti-government and 
anti-Church radicalism, while in Germany it reached deep into the middle classes 
and expressed a spiritualistic and nationalistic tone without threatening governments 
or established churches.[[19]][152]

Government responses varied widely. In France the government was hostile, and 
the philosophes fought against its censorship. They were sometimes imprisoned 
or hounded into exile. The British government generally ignored the Enlightenment's 
leaders in England and Scotland, although it did give Isaac Newton a knighthood 
and a very lucrative government office in charge of the mint.

### 
[[edit][153]] Enlightened absolutism

Main article: [Enlightened absolutism][59]

In several nations, powerful rulers – called "enlightened despots" by historians 
– welcomed leaders of the Enlightenment at court and had them help design laws 
and programs to reform the system, typically to build stronger [national states][154].[[20]][155] 
The most prominent of those rulers were [Frederick the Great][156] of Prussia, 
[Catherine the Great][157], Empress of Russia from 1762 to 1796, and [Joseph 
II][158], Emperor of Austria 1780–1790. Joseph was over-enthusiastic, announcing 
so many reforms that had so little support, that revolts broke out and his 
regime became a comedy of errors and nearly all his programs were reversed.[[21]][159] 
Senior ministers [Pombal in Portugal][160] and [Struensee in Denmark][161] 
governed according to Enlightenment ideals.

### 
[[edit][162]] North America

Main article: [American Enlightenment][69]

The Americans closely followed English and Scottish political ideas, as well 
as some French thinkers such as [Montesquieu][163].[[22]][164][[23]][165] During 
the enlightenment there was a great emphasis upon [liberty][166], [democracy][167], 
[republicanism][168] and [religious tolerance][169] - culminating in the drafting 
of the [United States Declaration of Independence][170]. Attempts to reconcile 
[science and religion][171] resulted in a widespread rejection of [prophecy][172], 
[miracle][173] and [revealed religion][174] in preference for [Deism][175] 
- especially by [Thomas Paine][176] in "[The Age of Reason][177]" and by [Thomas 
Jefferson][71] in his short [Jefferson Bible][178] - from which all supernatural 
aspects were removed.

[Benjamin Franklin][70] was influential in America, England, Scotland[[24]][179] 
and France, for his political activism and for his advances in physics.[[25]][180] 

### 
[[edit][181]] Prussia and the German States

By the mid-18th century the German Enlightenment in music, philosophy, science 
and literature emerged as an intellectual force. [Frederick the Great][156] 
(1712–86), the king of [Prussia][182] 1740–1786, saw himself as a leader of 
the Enlightenment and patronized philosophers and scientists at his court in 
Berlin. He was an enthusiast for French ideas as he ridiculed German culture 
and was unaware of the remarkable advances it was undergoing. Voltaire, who 
had been imprisoned and maltreated by the French government, was eager to accept 
Frederick's invitation to live at his palace. Frederick explained, "My principal 
occupation is to combat ignorance and prejudice ... to enlighten minds, cultivate 
morality, and to make people as happy as it suits human nature, and as the 
means at my disposal permit.[[26]][183] Other rulers were supportive, such 
as [Karl Friedrich][184], Grand Duke of Baden, who ruled Baden for 73 years 
(1738–1811).[[27]][185]

[![][186]][187]

[![][150]][187]

_Weimar's Courtyard of the Muses_ demonstrates the importance of Weimar. Schiller is reading; on the far left (seated) Wieland and Herder, Goethe standing on the right in front of the pillar. 1860 painting by [Theobald von Oer][188] [Christian Wolff][135] (1679–1754) was the pioneer as a writer who expounded the Enlightenment to German readers; he legitimized German as a philosophic language.[[28]][189]

[Johann Gottfried von Herder][190] (1744–1803) broke new ground in philosophy 
and poetry, specifically in the [Sturm und Drang][191] movement of proto-Romanticism. 
[Weimar Classicism][192] ("Weimarer Klassik") was a cultural and literary movement 
based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, 
classical and Enlightenment ideas. The movement, from 1772 until 1805, involved 
Herder as well as polymath [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe][193] (1749–1832) and 
[Friedrich Schiller][194] (1759–1805), a poet and historian. Herder argued 
that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its 
language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and 
culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schiller's 
plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero's 
struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.[[29]][195]

German music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers [Johann 
Sebastian Bach][196] (1685–1750), [Joseph Haydn][197] (1732–1809), and [Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozart][198] (1756–1791).[[30]][199]

In remote [Königsberg][200] philosopher [Immanuel Kant][117] (1724–1804) tried 
to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual freedom and political 
authority. Kant's work contained basic tensions that would continue to shape 
German thought – and indeed all of European philosophy – well into the 20th 
century.[[31]][201]

The German Enlightenment won the support of princes, aristocrats and the middle 
classes and permanently reshaped the culture.[[32]][202]

### 
[[edit][203]] England

[John Locke][55] was one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers. He 
influenced other thinkers such as Rousseau, Voltaire, among others. "He is 
one of the dozen or so thinkers who are remembered for their influential contributions 
across a broad spectrum of philosophical subfields--in Locke's case, across 
epistemology, the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mind, metaphysics, 
rational theology, ethics, and political philosophy."

Closely associated with the [1st Earl of Shaftesbury][204], who led the parliamentary 
grouping that later became the Whig party, Locke is still known today for his 
liberalism in political theory. The main goal that most people remember about 
him is his famous words of "Life, Liberty and Property." With property he stated 
that it is a natural right derived from labor. He was more of a positive Enlightenment 
thinker and often disagreed with others that related to [Thomas Hobbes][205]. 
Tutored by Locke, [Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury][206] wrote 
in 1706 "There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially 
in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe 
now turn".[[33]][207]

### 
[[edit][208]] Scotland

Main article: [Scottish Enlightenment][209]

[![][210]][211]

[![][150]][211]

 One leader of the Scottish Enlightenment was [Adam Smith][212], the father of modern economic science.

In the 18th-century, influential thinkers as [Francis Hutcheson][213], [Adam 
Smith][212] and [David Hume][214], paved the way for the modernization of Scotland 
and [the entire Atlantic world][215].[[34]][216] Hutcheson, the father of the 
Scottish Enlightenment, championed political liberty and the right of popular 
rebellion against tyranny. Smith, in his monumental _Wealth of Nations_ (1776), 
advocated liberty in the sphere of commerce and the global economy. Hume developed 
philosophical concepts that directly influenced [James Madison][217] and thus 
the U.S. Constitution. In 19th-century Britain, the Scottish Enlightenment, 
as popularized by [Dugald Stewart][218], became the basis of classical liberalism.[[35]][219] 

Scientific progress was led by [James Hutton][220], [William Thomson, 1st Baron 
Kelvin][221], and [James Watt][222] (instrument maker to the [University of 
Glasgow][223]), who perfected the crucial technology of the Industrial Revolution: 
the steam engine.[[36]][224]

### 
[[edit][225]] Russia

Main article: [Russian Enlightenment][226]

In Russia Enlightenment of the mid-eighteenth century saw the government begin 
to actively encourage the proliferation of arts and sciences. This era produced 
the first Russian university, library, theatre, public museum, and independent 
press. Like other [enlightened despots][59], [Catherine the Great][157] played 
a key role in fostering the arts, sciences, and education. She used her own 
interpretation of Enlightenment ideals, assisted by notable international experts 
such as Voltaire (by correspondence) and, in residence, world class scientists 
such as [Leonhard Euler][227], [Peter Simon Pallas][228], Fedor Ivanovich Iankovich 
de Mirievo (also spelled Teodor Janković-Mirijevski), and [Anders Johan Lexell][229]. 
The national Enlightenment differed from its Western European counterpart in 
that it promoted further [Modernization][230] of all aspects of Russian life 
and was concerned with attacking the institution of [serfdom in Russia][231]. 
Historians argue that the Russian enlightenment centered on the individual 
instead of societal enlightenment and encouraged the living of an enlightened 
life.[[37]][232][[38]][233]

### 
[[edit][234]] Spain

Main article: [Enlightenment in Spain][235]

[Charles III][236], king of Spain from 1759 to 1788, tried to rescue his empire 
from decay through far-reaching reforms such as weakening the Church and its 
monasteries, promoting science and university research, facilitating trade 
and commerce, modernizing agriculture, and avoiding wars. He was unable to 
control budget deficits, and borrowed more and more. Spain relapsed after his 
death.[[39]][237][[40]][238]

### 
[[edit][239]] Poland

Main article: [Enlightenment in Poland][240]

The Age of Enlightenment reached [Poland][241] later than in Germany or Austria, 
as [szlachta][242] (nobility) culture ([Sarmatism][243]) together with the 
[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth][244] [political system][245] ([Golden Freedoms][246]) 
were in deep crisis. The period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s, 
peaked in the reign of Poland's last king, [Stanisław August Poniatowski][247] 
(second half of the 18th century), went into decline with the [Third Partition 
of Poland][248] (1795), and ended in 1822, replaced by [Romanticism in Poland][249]. 
The model constitution of 1791 expressed Enlightenment ideals but was in effect 
for only one year as the nation was partitioned among its neighbors. More enduring 
were the cultural achievements, which created a nationalist spirit in Poland.[[41]][250] 

## 
[[edit][251]] Goals

[![][252]][253]

[![][150]][253]

 German philosopher [Immanuel Kant][117].

No brief summary can do justice to the diversity of enlightened thought in 
18th-century Europe. Because it was a value system rather than a set of shared 
beliefs, there are many contradictory trains to follow. As Outram notes, The 
Enlightenment comprised "many different paths, varying in time and geography, 
to the common goals of progress, of tolerance, and the removal of abuses in 
Church and state."[[42]][254]

In his famous essay "[What is Enlightenment?][255]" (1784), [Immanuel Kant][117] 
described it simply as freedom to use one's own intelligence.[[43]][256] More 
broadly, the Enlightenment period is marked by increasing empiricism, scientific 
rigor, and [reductionism][257], along with increasing questioning of religious 
orthodoxy.

Historian [Peter Gay][258] asserts the Enlightenment broke through "the sacred 
circle,"[[44]][259] whose dogma had circumscribed thinking. The Sacred Circle 
is a term he uses to describe the interdependent relationship between the hereditary 
aristocracy, the leaders of the church and the text of the Bible. This interrelationship 
manifests itself as kings invoking the doctrine "Divine Right of Kings" to 
rule. Thus church sanctioned the rule of the king and the king defended the 
church in return.

Zafirovski, (2010) argues that The Enlightenment is the source of critical 
ideas, such as the centrality of [freedom][260], democracy, and reason as primary 
values of society – as opposed to the divine right of kings or traditions as 
the ruling authority.[[45]][261] This view argues that the establishment of 
a contractual basis of rights would lead to the [market mechanism][262] and 
[capitalism][263], the [scientific method][264], religious [tolerance][265], 
and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic 
means. In this view, the tendency of the _[philosophes][66]_ in particular 
to apply [rationality][266] to every problem is considered the essential change.[[46]][267] 
Later critics of The Enlightenment, such as the [Romantics][60] of the 19th 
century, contended that its goals for rationality in human affairs were too 
ambitious to ever be achieved.[[47]][268]

A variety of 19th-century movements, including [liberalism][269] and [neo-classicism][270], 
traced their intellectual heritage back to the Enlightenment.[[48]][271]

## 
[[edit][272]] Social and cultural interpretation

In opposition to the intellectual historiographical approach of the Enlightenment, 
which examines the various currents, or discourses of intellectual thought 
within the European context during the 17th and 18th centuries, the cultural 
(or social) approach examines the changes that occurred in European society 
and culture. Under this approach, the Enlightenment is less a collection of 
thought than a process of changing sociabilities and cultural practices – both 
the "content" and the processes by which this content was spread are now important. 
[Roger Chartier][273] describes it as follows:

> 
> This movement [from the intellectual to the cultural/social] implies casting 
> doubt on two ideas: first, that practices can be deduced from the discourses 
> that authorize or justify them; second, that it is possible to translate into 
> the terms of an explicit ideology the latent meaning of social mechanisms.[[49]][274] 
> 

One of the primary elements of the cultural interpretation of the Enlightenment 
is the rise of the [public sphere][275] in Europe. [Jürgen Habermas][276] has 
influenced thinking on the public sphere more than any other, though his model 
is increasingly called into question. The essential problem that Habermas attempted 
to answer concerned the conditions necessary for "rational, critical, and genuinely 
open discussion of public issues". Or, more simply, the social conditions required 
for Enlightenment ideas to be spread and discussed. His response was the formation 
in the late 17th century and 18th century of the "bourgeois public sphere", 
a "realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate, more open and accessible 
forms of urban public space and sociability, and an explosion of print culture".[[50]][277] 
More specifically, Habermas highlights three essential elements of the public 
sphere:

1. it was egalitarian;
2. it discussed the domain of "common concern";
3. argument was founded on reason.[[51]][278]

[![][279]][280]

[![][150]][280]

 German explorer [Alexander von Humboldt][281] showed his disgust for slavery and often criticized the colonial policies. He always acted out of a deeply humanistic conviction, borne by the ideas of the Enlightenment.[[52]][282]

James Van Horn Melton provides a good summary of the values of this bourgeois 
public sphere: its members held reason to be supreme; everything was open to 
criticism (the public sphere is [critical][283]); and its participants opposed 
secrecy of all sorts.[[53]][284] This helps explain what Habermas meant by 
the domain of "common concern". Habermas uses the term to describe those areas 
of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive 
territory of the state and religious authorities, now open to critical examination 
by the public sphere.

Habermas credits the creation of the bourgeois public sphere to two long-term 
historical trends: the rise of the modern nation state and the rise of capitalism. 
The modern nation state in its consolidation of public power created by counterpoint 
a private realm of society independent of the state – allowing for the public 
sphere. Capitalism likewise increased society's autonomy and self-awareness, 
along with creating an increasing need for the exchange of information. As 
the nascent public sphere expanded, it embraced a large variety of institutions; 
the most commonly cited being coffee houses and cafés, salons and the literary 
public sphere, figuratively localized in the Republic of Letters.[[54]][285] 

Dorinda Outram provides further description of the rise of the public sphere. 
The context of the rise of the public sphere was the economic and social change 
commonly grouped under the effects of the [Industrial Revolution][286]: "economic 
expansion, increasing urbanisation, rising population and improving communications 
in comparison to the stagnation of the previous century". Rising efficiency 
in production techniques and communication lowered the prices of consumer goods 
at the same time as it increased the amount and variety of goods available 
to consumers (including the literature essential to the public sphere). Meanwhile, 
the colonial experience (most European states had colonial Empires in the 18th 
century) began to expose European society to extremely heterogeneous cultures. 
Outram writes that the end result was the breaking down of "barriers between 
cultural systems, religious divides, gender differences and geographical areas". 
In short, the social context was set for the public sphere to come into existence.[[55]][287] 

A reductionist view of the Habermasian model has been used as a springboard 
to showcase historical investigations into the development of the public sphere. 
There are many examples of noble and lower class participation in areas such 
as the coffeehouses and the freemasonic lodges, demonstrating that the bourgeois-era 
public sphere was enriched by cross-class influences. A rough depiction of 
the public sphere as independent and critical of the state is contradicted 
by the diverse cases of government-sponsored public institutions and government 
participation in debate, along with the cases of private individuals using 
public venues to promote the status quo.

### 
[[edit][288]] Exclusivity of the public sphere

The word "public" implies the highest level of inclusivity – the public sphere 
by definition should be open to all. However, as the analysis of many "public" 
institutions of the Enlightenment will show, this sphere was only public to 
relative degrees. Indeed, as Roger Chartier emphasizes, Enlightenment thinkers 
frequently contrasted their conception of the "public" with that of the people: 
Chartier cites [Condorcet][289], who contrasted "opinion" with populace; [Marmontel][290] 
with "the opinion of men of letters" versus "the opinion of the multitude"; 
and [d'Alembert][291], who contrasted the "truly enlightened public" with "the 
blind and noisy multitude".[[56]][292]

As Mona Ozouf underlines, public opinion was defined in opposition to the opinion 
of the greater population. While the nature of public opinion during the Enlightenment 
is as difficult to define as it is today, it is nonetheless clear that the 
body that held it (i.e. the public sphere) was exclusive rather than inclusive. 
This observation will become more apparent during the descriptions of the institutions 
of the public sphere, most of which excluded both women and the lower classes. 

### 
[[edit][293]] Social and cultural implications in music

Because of the focus on reason over superstition, the Enlightenment cultivated 
the arts.[[57]][294] Emphasis on learning, art and music became more widespread, 
especially with the growing middle class. Areas of study such as literature, 
philosophy, science, and the fine arts increasingly explored subject matter 
that the general public in addition to the previously more segregated professionals 
and patrons could relate to.[[58]][295]

[![][296]][297]

[![][150]][297]

[George Frideric Handel][298].

As musicians depended more and more on public support, public concerts became 
increasingly popular and helped supplement performers and composers incomes. 
The concerts also helped them to reach a wider audience. [Handel][299], for 
example, epitomized this with his highly public musical activities in [London][300]. 
He gained considerable fame there with performances of his operas and oratorios. 
The music of [Haydn][301] and [Mozart][302], with their Viennese Classical 
styles, are usually regarded as being the most in line with the Enlightenment 
ideals.[[59]][303]

Another important text that came about as a result of Enlightenment values 
was [Charles Burney][304]’s _A General History of Music: From the Earliest 
Ages to the Present Period_, originally published in 1776. This text was a 
historical survey and an attempt to rationalize elements in music systematically 
over time.[[60]][305]

As the economy and the middle class expanded, there was an increasing number 
of amateur musicians. One manifestation of this involves women; this movement 
allowed women to become more involved with music on a social level. Though 
women were not yet in professional roles (except for singers), they contributed 
to the amateur performers scene, especially with keyboard music.[[61]][306] 

The desire to explore, record and systematize knowledge had a meaningful impact 
on music publications. [Jean-Jacques Rousseau][67]’s _Dictionnaire de musique_ 
(published 1767 in Geneva and 1768 in Paris) was a leading text in the late 
18th century.[[59]][303] This widely-available dictionary gave short definitions 
of words like genius and taste, and was clearly influenced by the Enlightenment 
movement. Additionally, music publishers began to cater to amateur musicians, 
putting out music that they could understand and play. The majority of the 
works that were published were for keyboard, voice and keyboard, and chamber 
ensemble.[[61]][306]

After these initial genres were popularized, from the mid-century on, amateur 
groups sang choral music, which then became a new trend for publishers to capitalize 
on. The increasing study of the fine arts, as well as access to amateur-friendly 
published works, led to more people becoming interested in reading and discussing 
music. Music magazines, reviews, and critical works which suited amateurs as 
well as connoisseurs began to surface.[[61]][306]

Although the ideals of the Enlightenment were rejected in [postmodernism][307], 
they held fast in [modernism][308] and have extended well beyond the 18th century 
even to the present. Recently, musicologists have shown renewed interest in 
the ideas and consequences of the Enlightenment. For example, Rose Rosengard 
Subotnik’s _Deconstructive Variations_ (subtitled _Music and Reason in Western 
Society_) compares Mozart’s _Die Zauberflöte_ (1791) using the Enlightenment 
and Romantic perspectives, and concludes that the work is “an ideal musical 
representation of the Enlightenment”.[[60]][305]

## 
[[edit][309]] Dissemination of ideas

The philosophes spent a great deal of energy disseminating their ideas among 
educated men and women in cosmopolitan cities. They used many venues, some 
of them quite new.

### 
[[edit][310]] Schools and universities

In Germany and Scotland, the Enlightenment leaders were based in universities.[[62]][311] 
However, in general the universities and schools of France and most of Europe 
were bastions of traditionalism and were not hospitable to the Enlightenment. 
In France the major exception was the medical university at Montpellier.[[63]][312] 

### 
[[edit][313]] Learned academies

[![][314]][315]

[![][150]][315]

[Louis XIV][316] visiting the [Académie des sciences][317] in 1671. "It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century, introducing a new understanding of the natural world." —Peter Barrett[[64]][318]

The history of Academies in France during the Enlightenment begins with the 
[Academy of Science][317], founded in 1666 in Paris. It was closely tied to 
the French state, acting as an extension of a government seriously lacking 
in scientists. It helped promote and organize new disciplines, and it trained 
new scientists. It also contributed to the enhancement of scientists’ social 
status, considered them to be the "most useful of all citizens". Academies 
demonstrate the [rising interest in science][319] along with its increasing 
secularization, as evidenced by the small number of clerics who were members 
(13 percent).[[65]][320]

The presence of the French academies in the public sphere cannot be attributed 
to their membership; although the majority of their members were bourgeois, 
the exclusive institution was only open to elite Parisian scholars. They did 
perceive themselves to be "interpreters of the sciences for the people". Indeed, 
it was with this in mind that academians took it upon themselves to disprove 
the popular pseudo-science of [mesmerism][321].[[66]][322]

However, the strongest case for the French Academies being part of the public 
sphere comes the concours académiques (roughly translated as academic contests) 
they sponsored throughout France. As Jeremy L. Caradonna argues in a recent 
article in the _Annales_, "Prendre part au siècle des Lumières: Le concours 
académique et la culture intellectuelle au XVIIIe siècle", these academic contests 
were perhaps the most public of any institution during the Enlightenment.

_[L’Académie française][323]_ revived a practice dating back to the Middle 
Ages when it revived public contests in the mid-17th century. The subject matter 
was generally religious and/or monarchical, and featured essays, poetry, and 
painting. By roughly 1725, however, this subject matter had radically expanded 
and diversified, including "royal propaganda, philosophical battles, and critical 
ruminations on the social and political institutions of the Old Regime." Controversial 
topics were not always avoided: Caradonna cites as examples the theories of 
Newton and Descartes, the slave trade, women's education, and justice in France.[[67]][324] 

More importantly, the contests were open to all, and the enforced anonymity 
of each submission guaranteed that neither gender nor social rank would determine 
the judging. Indeed, although the "vast majority" of participants belonged 
to the wealthier strata of society ("the liberal arts, the clergy, the judiciary, 
and the medical profession"), there were some cases of the popular classes 
submitting essays, and even winning.[[68]][325]

Similarly, a significant number of women participated – and won – the competitions. 
Of a total of 2 300 prize competitions offered in France, women won 49 – perhaps 
a small number by modern standards, but very significant in an age in which 
most women did not have any academic training. Indeed, the majority of the 
winning entries were for poetry competitions, a genre commonly stressed in 
women's education.[[69]][326]

In England, the [Royal Society of London][327] also played a significant role 
in the public sphere and the spread of Enlightenment ideas. In particular, 
it played a large role in spreading [Robert Boyle][328]'s [experimental philosophy][329] 
around Europe, and acted as a clearinghouse for intellectual correspondence 
and exchange.[[70]][330] As Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer have argued, Robert 
Boyle was "a founder of the experimental world in which scientists now live 
and operate". Boyle's method based knowledge on experimentation, which had 
to be witnessed to provide proper empirical legitimacy. This is where the Royal 
Society came into play: witnessing had to be a "collective act", and the Royal 
Society's assembly rooms were ideal locations for relatively public demonstrations.[[71]][331] 

However, not just any witness was considered to be credible; "Oxford professors 
were accounted more reliable witnesses than Oxfordshire peasants." Two factors 
were taken into account: a witness's knowledge in the area; and a witness's 
"moral constitution". In other words, only civil society were considered for 
Boyle's public.[[72]][332]

### 
[[edit][333]] The book industry

The increased consumption of reading materials of all sorts was one of the 
key features of the "social" Enlightenment. Developments in the [Industrial 
Revolution][286] allowed consumer goods to be produced in greater quantities 
at lower prices, encouraging the spread of books, pamphlets, newspapers and 
journals – "media of the transmission of ideas and attitudes". Commercial development 
likewise increased the demand for information, along with rising populations 
and increased urbanisation.[[73]][334] However, demand for reading material 
extended outside of the realm of the commercial, and outside the realm of the 
upper and middle classes, as evidenced by the Bibliothèque Bleue. Literacy 
rates are difficult to gauge, but Robert Darnton writes that, in France at 
least, the rates doubled over the course of the 18th century.[[74]][335]

Reading underwent serious changes in the 18th century. In particular, Rolf 
Engelsing has argued for the existence of a _[Reading Revolution][336]_. Until 
1750, reading was done "intensively: people tended to own a small number of 
books and read them repeatedly, often to small audience. After 1750, people 
began to read "extensively", finding as many books as they could, increasingly 
reading them alone.[[75]][337] On the other hand, as Jonathan Israel writes, 
Gabriel Naudé was already campaigning for the "universal" library in the mid-17th 
century. And if this was an ideal only realistic for state institutions and 
the very wealthy (and indeed, an ideal that was seldom achieved), there are 
records for extremely large private and state-run libraries throughout Europe 
in the 17th and 18th-centuries.[[76]][338]

Of course, the vast majority of the reading public could not afford to own 
a private library. And while most of the state-run "universal libraries" set 
up in the 17th and 18th centuries were open to the public, they were not the 
only sources of reading material.

On one end of the spectrum was the _Bibliothèque Bleue_, a collection of cheaply 
produced books published in Troyes, France. Intended for a largely rural and 
semi-literate audience these books included almanacs, retellings of medieval 
romances and condensed versions of popular novels, among other things. While 
historians, such as Roger Chartier and Robert Darnton, have argued against 
the Enlightenment's penetration into the lower classes, the Bibliothèque Bleue, 
at the very least, represents a desire to participate in Enlightenment sociability, 
whether or not this was actually achieved.[[77]][339]

Moving up the classes, a variety of institutions offered readers access to 
material without needing to buy anything. Libraries that lent out their material 
for a small price started to appear, and occasionally bookstores would offer 
a small lending library to their patrons. Coffee houses commonly offered books, 
journals and sometimes even popular novels to their customers. _[The Tatler][340]_ 
and _[The Spectator][341]_, two influential periodicals sold from 1709 to 1714, 
were closely associated with coffee house culture in London, being both read 
and produced in various establishments in the city.[[78]][342] Indeed, this 
is an example of the triple or even quadruple function of the coffee house: 
reading material was often obtained, read, discussed and even produced on the 
premises.[[79]][343]

[![][344]][345]

[![][150]][345]

[Denis Diderot][65] is best known as the editor of the _[Encyclopédie][64]_.

As Darnton describes in _The Literary Underground of the Old Regime_, it is 
extremely difficult to determine what people actually read during the Enlightenment. 
For example, examining the catalogs of private libraries not only gives an 
image skewed in favor of the classes wealthy enough to afford libraries, it 
also ignores censured works unlikely to be publicly acknowledged. For this 
reason, Darnton argues that a study of publishing would be much more fruitful 
for discerning reading habits.[[80]][346]

All across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers 
had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. The _Encyclopédie_, 
for example, narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by [Malesherbes][347], 
the man in charge of the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies 
were conveniently located outside of France so as to avoid overzealous French 
censors. They would smuggle their merchandise – both pirated copies and censured 
works – across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine 
booksellers or small-time peddlers.[[81]][348]

Darnton provides a detailed record of one clandestine bookseller's (one de 
Mauvelain) business in the town of Troyes. At the time, the town's population 
was 22,000. It had one masonic lodge and an "important" library, even though 
the literacy rate seems to have been less than 50 percent. Mauvelain's records 
give us a good representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, 
since the clandestine nature of his business provided a less restrictive product 
choice. The most popular category of books was political (319 copies ordered).[[82]][349] 

This included five copies of D’Holbach's _Système social_, but around 300 libels 
and pamphlets. Readers were far more interested in sensationalist stories about 
criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. 
The second most popular category, "general works" (those books "that did not 
have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone 
in authority") likewise betrayed the high demand for generally low-brow subversive 
literature. These works, however, like the vast majority of work produced by 
Darnton's "grub street hacks", never became part of literary canon, and are 
largely forgotten today as a result.[[83]][350]

Nevertheless, the Enlightenment was not the exclusive domain of illegal literature, 
as evidenced by the healthy, and mostly legal, publishing industry that existed 
throughout Europe. "Mostly legal" because even established publishers and book 
sellers occasionally ran afoul of the law. The Encyclopédie, for example, condemned 
not only by the King but also by Clement XII, nevertheless found its way into 
print with the help of the aforementioned Malesherbes and creative use of French 
censorship law.[[84]][351]

But many works were sold without running into any legal trouble at all. Borrowing 
records from libraries in England, Germany and North America indicate that 
more than 70 percent of books borrowed were novels; that less than 1 percent 
of the books were of a religious nature supports a general trend of declining 
religiosity.[[85]][352]

### 
[[edit][353]] Natural history

Main article: [Natural History][354]

[![][355]][356]

[![][150]][356]

[Georges Buffon][357] is best remembered for his _Histoire naturelle_, a 44 volume encyclopedia describing everything known about the natural world.

A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. 
Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. 
Works of natural history include [René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur][358]'s 
_Histoire naturelle des insectes_ and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's _La Myologie 
complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain_ (1746). However, 
as François-Alexandre Aubert de La Chesnaye des Bois's _Dictionnaire de la 
Noblesse_ (1770) indicates, natural history was very often a political affair. 
As E. C. Spary writes, the classifications used by naturalists "slipped between 
the natural world and the social ... to establish not only the expertise of 
the naturalists over the natural, but also the dominance of the natural over 
the social".[[86]][359] From this basis, naturalists could then develop their 
own social ideals based on their scientific works.[[87]][360]

The target audience of natural history was French polite society, evidenced 
more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices 
of its works. Naturalists catered to polite society's desire for erudition 
– many texts had an explicit instructive purpose. But the idea of taste (_le 
goût_) was the real social indicator: to truly be able to categorize nature, 
one had to have the proper taste, an ability of discretion shared by all members 
of polite society. In this way natural history spread many of the scientific 
development of the time, but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the 
dominant class.[[88]][361]

### 
[[edit][362]] Scientific and literary journals

The many scientific and literary journals (predominantly composed of book reviews) 
that were published during this time are also evidence of the intellectual 
side of the Enlightenment. In fact, Jonathan Israel argues that the learned 
journals, from the 1680s onwards, influenced European intellectual culture 
to a greater degree than any other "cultural innovation".[[89]][363]

The first journal appeared in 1665– the Parisian _[Journal des Sçavans][364]_ 
– but it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. 
French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication, but there was 
also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally 
low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's 
similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international 
market – such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese – found journal success more 
difficult, and more often than not, a more international language was used 
instead. Although German did have an international quality to it, it was French 
that slowly took over Latin's status as the _[lingua franca][365]_ of learned 
circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland, 
where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced.[[90]][366] 

Israel divides the journals’ intellectual importance into four elements. First 
was their role in shifting the attention of the "cultivated public" away from 
"established authorities" to "what was new, innovative, or challenging." Secondly, 
they did much to promote the "‘enlightened’ ideals of toleration and intellectual 
objectivity." Thirdly, the journals were an implicit critique of existing notions 
of universal truth monopolized by monarchies, parliaments, and religious authorities. 
The journals suggested a new source of knowledge – through science and reason 
– that undermined these sources of authority. And finally, they advanced Christian 
enlightenment that upheld "the legitimacy of God-ordained authority"--the Bible--in 
which there had to be agreement between the biblical and natural theories.[[91]][367] 

### 
[[edit][368]] The Republic of Letters

Main article: [Republic of Letters][369]

[![][370]][371]

[![][150]][371]

 French philosopher [Pierre Bayle][56].

The term "Republic of Letters" was coined by [Pierre Bayle][56] in 1664, in 
his journal _Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres_. Towards the end of the 
18th century, the editor of _Histoire de la République des Lettres en France_, 
a literary survey, described the Republic of Letters as being:

> 
> In the midst of all the governments that decide the fate of men; in the bosom 
> of so many states, the majority of them despotic ... there exists a certain 
> realm which holds sway only over the mind ... that we honour with the name 
> Republic, because it preserves a measure of independence, and because it is 
> almost its essence to be free. It is the realm of talent and of thought.[[85]][352] 
> 

The ideal of the Republic of Letters was the sum of a number of Enlightenment 
ideals: an egalitarian realm governed by knowledge that could act across political 
boundaries and rival state power.[[85]][352] It was a forum that supported 
"free public examination of questions regarding religion or legislation".[[92]][372] 
Immanuel Kant considered written communication essential to his conception 
of the public sphere; once everyone was a part of the "reading public", then 
society could be said to be enlightened.[[93]][373] The people who participated 
in the Republic of Letters, such as [Diderot][374] and [Voltaire][58], are 
frequently known today as important Enlightenment figures. Indeed, the men 
who wrote Diderot's _Encyclopédie_ arguably formed a microcosm of the larger 
"republic".[[94]][375]

Dena Goodman has argued that women played a major role in French salons – _salonnières_ 
to complement the male _philosophes_. Discursively, she bases the Republic 
of Letters in polite conversation and letter writing; its principal social 
institution was the salon.[[95]][376]

Robert Darnton's _The Literary Underground of the Old Regime_ was the first 
major historical work to critique this ideal model.[[96]][377] He argues that, 
by the mid-18th century, the established men of letters (_gens de lettres_) 
had fused with the elites (_les grands_) of French society. Consider the definition 
of "Goût" (taste) as written by [Voltaire][58] in the _Dictionnaire philosophique_ 
(taken from Darnton): "Taste is like philosophy. It belongs to a very small 
number of privileged souls ... It is unknown in bourgeois families, where one 
is constantly occupied with the care of one's fortune". In the words of Darnton, 
Voltaire "thought that the Enlightenment should begin with the _grands_".[[97]][378] 
The historian cites similar opinions from [d'Alembert][379] and [Louis Sébastien 
Mercier][380].[[98]][381]

### 
[[edit][382]] Grub Street

Darnton argues that the result of this "fusion of _gens de lettres_ and _grands_" 
was the creation of an oppositional literary sphere, [Grub Street][383], the 
domain of a "multitude of versifiers and would-be authors".[[99]][384] These 
men, lured by the glory of the Republic of Letters, came to Paris to become 
authors, only to discover that their dreams of literary success were little 
more than chimeras. The literary market simply could not support large numbers 
of writers, who, in any case, were very poorly remunerated by the publishing-bookselling 
[guilds][385].[[100]][386] The writers of Grub Street, the Grub Street Hacks, 
were left feeling extremely bitter about the relative success of their literary 
cousins, the men of letters.[[101]][387]

This bitterness and hatred found an outlet in the literature the Grub Street 
Hacks produced, typified by the _libelle_. Written mostly in the form of pamphlets, 
the _libelles_ "slandered the court, the Church, the aristocracy, the academies, 
the salons, everything elevated and respectable, including the monarchy itself".[[102]][388] 
Darnton designates _Le Gazetier cuirassé_ by Charles Théveneau de Morande as 
the prototype of the genre. Consider:

> 
> The devout wife of a certain Maréchal de France (who suffers from an imaginary 
> lung disease), finding a husband of that species too delicate, considers it 
> her religious duty to spare him and so condemns herself to the crude caresses 
> of her butler, who would still be a lackey if he hadn't proven himself so robust. 
> 

or,

> 
> The public is warned that an epidemic disease is raging among the girls of 
> the Opera, that is has begun to reach the ladies of the court, and that it 
> has even been communicated to their lackeys. This disease elongates the face, 
> destroys the complexion, reduces the weight, and causes horrible ravages where 
> it becomes situated. There are lades without teeth, others without eyebrows, 
> and some are completely paralyzed.[[103]][389]
> 

It was Grub Street literature that was most read by the reading public during 
the Enlightenment.[[104]][390] More importantly, Darnton argues, the Grub Street 
hacks inherited the "revolutionary spirit" once displayed by the _philosophes_, 
and paved the way for the Revolution by desacralizing figures of political, 
moral and religious authority in France.[[105]][391]

The first English coffeehouse opened in Oxford in 1650. Brian Cowan argues 
that Oxford coffeehouses developed into "[penny universities][400]", offering 
a locus of learning that was less formal than structured institutions. These 
penny universities occupied a significant position in Oxford academic life, 
as they were frequented by virtuosi, who conducted their research on the premises. 
According to Cowan, "the coffeehouse was a place for like-minded scholars to 
congregate, to read, as well as learn from and to debate with each other, but 
was emphatically not a university institution, and the discourse there was 
of a far different order than any university tutorial."[[106]][401]

[Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli][402] – François Procope – established the 
first café in Paris, the [Café Procope][397], in 1686; by the 1720s there were 
around 400 cafés in the city. The Café Procope in particular became a centre 
of Enlightenment, welcoming such celebrities as Voltaire and Rousseau. The 
Café Procope was where Diderot and D’Alembert decided to create the _Encyclopédie_.[[107]][403][Robert 
Darnton][404] in particular has studied Parisian café conversation in great 
detail. He describes how the cafés were one of the various "nerve centers" 
for _bruits publics_, public noise or rumour. These _bruits_ were allegedly 
a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available 
at the time.[[108]][405]

[[edit][406]] Debating societies

Main article: [London Debating Societies][407]

[[109]][408]

The Debating Societies that rapidly came into existence in 1780 London present 
an almost perfect example of the public sphere during the Enlightenment. Donna 
T Andrew provides four separate origins:

* Clubs of fifty or more men who, at the beginning of the 18th century, met in pubs to discuss religious issues and affairs of state.
* Mooting clubs, set up by law students to practice rhetoric.
* Spouting clubs, established to help actors train for theatrical roles.
*

[![][150]][412]

 An example of a French Salon

In any event, popular debating societies began, in the late 1770s, to move 
into more "genteel", or respectable rooms, a change which helped establish 
a new standard of sociability: "order, decency, and liberality", in the words 
of the Religious Society of Old Portugal Street.[[111]][413] Respectability 
was also encouraged by the higher admissions prices (ranging from 6d. to 3s.), 
which also contributed to the upkeep of the newer establishments. The backdrop 
to these developments was what Andrew calls "an explosion of interest in the 
theory and practice of public elocution". The debating societies were commercial 
enterprises that responded to this demand, sometimes very successfully. Indeed, 
some societies welcomed from 800 to 1200 spectators a night.[[112]][414]

These societies discussed an extremely wide range of topics. One broad area 
was women: societies debated over "male and female qualities", courtship, marriage, 
and the role of women in the public sphere. Societies also discussed political 
issues, varying from recent events to "the nature and limits of political authority", 
and the nature of suffrage. Debates on religion rounded out the subject matter. 
It is important to note, however, that the critical subject matter of these 
debates did not necessarily translate into opposition to the government. In 
other words, the results of the debate quite frequently upheld the status quo.[[113]][415] 

From a historical standpoint, one of the most important features of the debating 
society was their openness to the public; women attended and even participated 
in almost every debating society, which were likewise open to all classes providing 
they could pay the entrance fee. Once inside, spectators were able to participate 
in a largely egalitarian form of sociability that helped spread "Enlightening 
ideas".[[114]][416]

 Goose and Gridiron, where the [Grand Lodge of England][421] was founded.

Historians have recently been debating the extent to which [Freemasonry][418] 
was part of, or even a main factor in the Enlightenment. On the one hand, historians 
agree that the famous leaders of the Enlightenment included Freemasons such 
as Montesquieu, Voltaire, Pope, Horace Walpole, Sir Robert Walpole, Mozart, 
Goethe, Frederick the Great, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington.[[115]][422] 

On the other side, historians such as [Robert Roswell Palmer][423] concluded 
that even in France, Masons were politically "innocuous if not ridiculous" 
and did not act as a group.[[116]][424] American historians, while noting that 
[Benjamin Franklin][70] and [George Washington][425] were indeed active Masons, 
have downplayed the importance of Freemasonry in the era of the American Revolution 
because the movement was non-political and included both Patriots and their 
enemy the Loyalists.[[117]][426] Regarding the movement's influence on the 
European contintent, German historian Reinhart Koselleck claimed that "On the 
Continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on 
the Age of Enlightenment: the Republic of Letters and the Masonic lodges.",[[118]][427] 
while professor at University of Glasgow Thomas Munck argues that "although 
the Masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially 
non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values, they can hardly 
be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right."[[119]][428] 

Freemasonic lodges originated from English and Scottish [stonemasonic][429] 
[guilds][430] in the 17th century.[[120]][431] In the 18th century, they expanded 
into an extremely widespread collection of interconnected (to varying degrees) 
men's, and occasionally women's, associations which Margaret Jacob contends 
had their own mythologies and special codes of conduct - including a communal 
understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability – "liberty, 
fraternity, and equality"[[121]][432] The remarkable similarity between these 
values, which were generally common in Britain as on the Continent, and the 
French Revolutionary slogan of "[Liberté, égalité, fraternité][433]" spawned 
many conspiracy theories. Notably, [Abbé Barruel][434] traced the origins of 
the [Jacobins][435] – and hence the Revolution – to the French freemasons. 

Freemasonry was officially established on the continent of Europe in 1734, 
when a lodge was set up in The Hague, although the first "fully formed lodge" 
appears to have met in 1721 in Rotterdam. Similarly, there are records of a 
Parisian lodge meeting in 1725 or 1726.[[122]][436] As Daniel Roche writes, 
freemasonry was particularly prevalent in France – by 1789, there were perhaps 
as many as 100,000 French Masons, making Freemasonry the most popular of all 
Enlightenment associations.[[123]][437] Freemasonry does not appear to have 
been confined to Western Europe, however, as Margaret Jacob writes of lodges 
in Saxony in 1729 and in Russia in 1731.[[124]][438]

Conspiracy theories aside, it is likely that masonic lodges had an effect on 
society as a whole. Jacob argues that they "reconstituted the polity and established 
a constitutional form of self-government, complete with constitutions and laws, 
elections and representatives". In other words, the micro-society set up within 
the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially 
true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, 
their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. 
For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English 
[Jacobite][439] exiles.[[125]][440]

Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe made reference to the Enlightenment 
in general in the 18th century. In French lodges, for example, the line "As 
the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened" was a part of their 
initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to "initiate 
the unenlightened". This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious, 
but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy. In fact, many 
lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the divine 
being who created a scientifically ordered universe.[[126]][441]

On the other hand, Daniel Roche contests freemasonry's claims for egalitarianism, 
writing that "the real equality of the lodges was elitist", only attracting 
men of similar social backgrounds.[[127]][442] This lack of real equality was 
made explicit by the constitution of the Lausanne Switzerland lodge (1741): 

> 
> The order of freemasons is a society of confraternity and equality, and to 
> this end is represented under the emblem of a level ... a brother renders to 
> another brother the honour and deference that is justly due him in proportion 
> to his rank in the civil society.[[128]][443]
> 

Elitism was beneficial for some members of society. The presence, for example, 
of noble women in the French "lodges of adoption" that formed in the 1780s 
was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic 
society.[[129]][444][[130]][445]

## 
[[edit][448]] A historiographical overview

Enlightenment [historiography][449] began in the period itself, from what "Enlightenment 
figures" said about their work. A dominant element was the intellectual angle 
they took. [D'Alembert's][450] _Preliminary Discourse of l'Encyclopédie_ provides 
a history of the Enlightenment which comprises a chronological list of developments 
in the realm of knowledge – of which the _[Encyclopédie][64]_ forms the pinnacle.[[131]][451] 

A more philosophical example of this was the 1783 essay contest (in itself 
an activity typical of the Enlightenment) announced by the Berlin newspaper 
_Berlinische Monatsschrift_, which asked that very question: "What is Enlightenment?" 
Jewish philosopher [Moses Mendelssohn][452] was among those who responded, 
referring to Enlightenment as a process by which man was educated in the use 
of reason (_[Jerusalem][453]_, 1783).[[132]][454][Immanuel Kant][117] also 
wrote a response, referring to Enlightenment as "man's release from his self-incurred 
tutelage", tutelage being "man's inability to make use of his understanding 
without direction from another".[[133]][455] This intellectual model of interpretation 
has been adopted by many historians since the 18th century, and is perhaps 
the most commonly used interpretation today.

Dorinda Outram provides a good example of a standard, intellectual definition 
of the Enlightenment:

> 
> Enlightenment was a desire for human affairs to be guided by rationality rather 
> than by faith, superstition, or revelation; a belief in the power of human 
> reason to change society and liberate the individual from the restraints of 
> custom or arbitrary authority; all backed up by a world view increasingly validated 
> by science rather than by religion or tradition.
> 

[![][456]][457]

[![][150]][457]

 Like other Enlightenment philosophers, [Rousseau][458] was critical of the [Atlantic slave trade][459].[[134]][460]

Like the [French Revolution][124], the Enlightenment has long been hailed as 
the foundation of modern Western political and intellectual culture.[[135]][461] 
It has been frequently linked to the French Revolution of 1789. However, as 
Roger Chartier points out, it was perhaps the Revolution that "invented the 
Enlightenment by attempting to root its legitimacy in a corpus of texts and 
founding authors reconciled and united ... by their preparation of a rupture 
with the old world".[[136]][462]

In other words, the revolutionaries elevated to heroic status those philosophers, 
such as [Voltaire][58] and [Rousseau][458], who could be used to justify their 
radical break with the [Ancien Régime][463]. In any case, two 19th-century 
historians of the Enlightenment, [Hippolyte Taine][464] and [Alexis de Tocqueville][465], 
did much to solidify this link of Enlightenment causing revolution and the 
intellectual perception of the Enlightenment itself.

In his _l Régime_ (1876), [Hippolyte Taine][464] traced the roots of the French 
Revolution back to [French Classicism][466]. However, this was not without 
the help of the scientific view of the world [of the Enlightenment], which 
wore down the "monarchical and religious dogma of the old regime".[[137]][467] 
In other words then, Taine was only interested in the Enlightenment insofar 
as it advanced scientific discourse and transmitted what he perceived to be 
the intellectual legacy of French classicism.

[Alexis de Tocqueville][465] painted a more elaborate picture of the Enlightenment 
in _L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution_ (1850). For de Tocqueville, the Revolution 
was the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century 
between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men 
of letters constituted a sort of "substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful 
and without real power". This illusory power came from the rise of "public 
opinion", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the 
bourgeosie from the political sphere. The "literary politics" that resulted 
promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to 
the monarchical regime.[[138]][468]

From a historiographical point of view, de Tocqueville presents an interesting 
case. He was primarily concerned with the workings of political power under 
the Ancien Régime and the philosophical principles of the men of letters. However, 
there is a distinctly social quality to his analysis. In the words of Chartier, 
de Tocqueville "clearly designates ... the cultural effects of transformation 
in the forms of the exercise of power".[[139]][469] Nevertheless, for a serious 
cultural approach, one has to wait another century for the work of historians 
such as Robert Darnton, _The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History 
of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800_ (1979).

In the meantime, though, intellectual history remained the dominant historiographical 
trend. The German scholar [Ernst Cassirer][470] is typical, writing in his 
_The Philosophy of the Enlightenment_ (19321951) that the Enlightenment was 
" a part and a special phase of that whole intellectual development through 
which modern philosophic thought gained its characteristic self-confidence 
and self-consciousness". Borrowing from Kant, Cassirer states that Enlightenment 
is the process by which the spirit "achieves clarity and depth in its understanding 
of its own nature and destiny, and of its own fundamental character and mission".[[140]][471] 
In short, the Enlightenment was a series of philosophical, scientific and otherwise 
intellectual developments that took place mostly in the 18th century – the 
birthplace of intellectual modernity.

### 
[[edit][472]] Recent work

Only in the 1970s did interpretation of the Enlightenment allow for a more 
heterogeneous and even extra-European vision. [A. Owen Aldridge][473] demonstrated 
how Enlightenment ideas spread to Spanish colonies and how they interacted 
with indigenous cultures, while Franco Venturi explored how the Enlightenment 
took place in normally unstudied areas – Italy, Greece, the Balkans, Poland, 
Hungary, and Russia.[[141]][474]

[Robert Darnton][404]'s cultural approach launched a new dimension of studies. 
He said, :

> 
> "Perhaps the Enlightenment was a more down-to-earth affair than the rarefied 
> climate of opinion described by textbook writers, and we should question the 
> overly highbrow, overly metaphysical view of intellectual life in the eighteenth 
> century."[[142]][475]
> 

Darnton examines the underbelly of the French book industry in the 18th century, 
examining the world of book smuggling and the lives of those writers (the "Grub 
Street Hacks") who never met the success of their _[philosophe][476]_ cousins. 
In short, rather than concerning himself with Enlightenment canon, Darnton 
studies "what Frenchmen wanted to read", and who wrote, published and distributed 
it.[[143]][477] Similarly, in _The Business of Enlightenment. A Publishing 
History of the Encyclopédie 1775–1800_, Darnton states that there is no need 
to further study the encyclopædia itself, as "the book has been analyzed and 
anthologized dozen of times: to recapitulate all the studies of its intellectual 
content would be redundant".[[144]][478] He instead, as the title of the book 
suggests, examines the social conditions that brought about the production 
of the _Encyclopédie_. This is representative of the social interpretation 
as a whole – an examination of the social conditions that brought about Enlightenment 
ideas rather than a study of the ideas themselves.

 A medal minted during the reign of [Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor][158], commemorating his grant of religious liberty to [Jews][481] and [Protestants][482]. Another very important reform of Joseph II was the abolition of [serfdom][483].

The work of German philosopher [Jürgen Habermas][276] was central to this emerging 
social interpretation; his seminal work _The Structural Transformation of the 
Public Sphere_ (published under the title _Strukturwandel der Öffentlicheit_ 
in 1962) was translated into English in 1989. The book outlines the creation 
of the "bourgeois public sphere" in 18th century Europe. Essentially, this 
public sphere describes the new venues and modes of communication allowing 
for rational exchange that appeared in the 18th century. Habermas argued that 
the public sphere was bourgeois, egalitarian, rational, and independent from 
the state, making it the ideal venue for intellectuals to critically examine 
contemporary politics and society, away from the interference of established 
authority.

Habermas's work, though influential, has come under criticism on all fronts. 
While the public sphere is generally an integral component of social interpretations 
of the Enlightenment, numerous historians have brought into question whether 
the public sphere was bourgeois, oppositional to the state, independent from 
the state, or egalitarian.[[145]][484]

These historiographical developments have done much to open up the study of 
Enlightenment to a multiplicity of interpretations. In _A Social History of 
Truth_ (1994), for example, Steven Shapin makes the largely sociological argument 
that, in 17th-century England, the mode of sociability known as civility became 
the primary discourse of truth; for a statement to have the potential to be 
considered true, it had to be expressed according to the rules of civil society. 

Feminist interpretations have also appeared, with Dena Goodman being one notable 
example. In _The Republic of Letters: A Cultural History of the French Enlightenment_ 
(1994), Goodman argues that many women in fact played an essential part in 
the French Enlightenment, due to the role they played as _salonnières_ in Parisians 
salons. These salons "became the civil working spaces of the project of Enlightenment" 
and women, as salonnières, were "the legitimate governors of [the] potentially 
unruly discourse" that took place within.[[146]][485] On the other hand, Carla 
Hesse, in _The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern_ (2001), 
argues that "female participation in the public cultural life of the Old Regime 
was ... relatively marginal".[[147]][486] It was instead the French Revolution, 
by destroying the old cultural and economic restraints of patronage and corporatism 
(guilds), that opened French society to female participation, particularly 
in the literary sphere.

All this is not to say that intellectual interpretations no longer exist. Jonathan 
Israel, for example, in _Enlightenment Contested: Philosophy, Modernity, and 
the Emancipation of Man, 1670–1752_ (2006), constructs an argument that is 
primarily intellectual in scope. Like many historians before him, he sets the 
Enlightenment within the context of the French Revolution to follow. Israel 
argues that only an intellectual interpretation can adequately explain the 
radical break with Ancien Régime society.[[148]][487][[149]][488]
