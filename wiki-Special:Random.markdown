The term **thegn** (or **thane** or **thayn** in [Shakespearean English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_English "Shakespearean English")), from [OE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") _þegn_, _ðegn_ "servant, attendant, retainer," "one who serves" [1] is commonly used to describe either an aristocratic retainer of a king or [nobleman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility "Nobility") in [Anglo-Saxon England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_England "Anglo-Saxon England"), or as a class term, the majority of the aristocracy below the ranks of [ealdormen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealdormen "Ealdormen") and [high-reeves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-reeve "High-reeve"). It is also the term for an [early medieval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages "Early Middle Ages") [Scandinavian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia") class of retainers.

## Etymology

[Old English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English "Old English") _þeg(e)n_ "servant, attendant, retainer" is [cognate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate_(etymology) "Cognate (etymology)") with [Old High German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German "Old High German") _degan_ and Old Norse _þegn_ ("thane, franklin, freeman, man"). [2]

The **thegn** had a military significance, and its usual [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") translation was _miles_, meaning soldier, although _minister_ was often used. [Joseph Bosworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bosworth "Joseph Bosworth") [3] describes a thegn as "one engaged in a king's or a queen's service, whether in the household or in the country," and adds, "the word in this case seems gradually to acquire a technical meaning, and to become a term denoting a class, containing, however, several degrees."

But, like all other words of the kind, the word _thegn_ was slowly changing its meaning, and, as William Stubbs says (_Constitutional History_, vol. i.), "the very name, like that of the _gesith_, has different senses in different ages and kingdoms, but the original idea of military service runs through all the meanings of _thegn_, as that of personal association is traceable in all the applications of _gesith_." After the [Norman conquest of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England "Norman conquest of England") in 1066, [William the Conqueror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror "William the Conqueror") replaced the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy with Normans and the new Norman French ruling class replaced the Anglo-Saxon terminology with Norman French. In this process, king's thegns became barons, and thegns appear to have been merged in the class of [knights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight "Knight").

## Gesith and thegns

The precursor of the thegn was the _gesith_, the companion of the king or great lord, a member of his [_comitatus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitatus_(classical_meaning) "Comitatus (classical meaning)"), and the word thegn began to be used to describe a military _gesith_. [4]

It is only used once in the laws before the time of [Aethelstan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athelstan_of_England "Athelstan of England") (c. 895-940), but more frequently in the charters. [H. M. Chadwick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._M._Chadwick "H. M. Chadwick") says that "the sense of subordination must have been inherent in the word from the earliest time," [5] but it has no connection with the [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language") _dienen_, to serve. In the course of time it extended its meaning and was more generally used. The thegn became a member of a territorial nobility, and the dignity of thegnhood was attainable by those who fulfilled certain conditions. The nobility of pre-Conquest England was ranked according to the [heriot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heriot "Heriot") they paid in the following descending order: earl, king's thegn, median thegn. In Anglo-Saxon hierarchic society, a king's thegn attended in person upon the king, bringing with him his men and resources. A "median" thegn did not hold his land directly from the king but through an intermediary lord.

## Status

The thegn was inferior to the _ [ætheling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86theling "Ætheling")_, the member of a kingly family, but he was superior to the ceorl, and, says Chadwick, "from the time of Æthelstan the distinction between thegn and ceorl was the broad line of demarcation between the classes of society." His status is shown by his _ [wergild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wergild "Wergild")_. Over a large part of England this was fixed at 1200 [shillings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling "Shilling"), or six times that of the ceorl. He was the _twelfhynde_ man of the laws, sharply divided from the _twyhynde_ man or ceorl.

### _Geþyncðo_, _Rectitudines Singularum Personarum_ and _Norðleoda laga_

In a document known as _ [Geþyncðo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%C3%BEync%C3%B0o "Geþyncðo")_ we learn: "And if a [ceorl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churl "Churl") throve, so that he had fully [five hides of his own land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_medieval_land_terms "List of medieval land terms"), church and kitchen, bellhouse and burh-gate-seat, and special duty in the king's hail, then was he thenceforth of thegn-right worthy." [6] A hide of land was considered sufficient to support a family. And again—"And if a merchant throve, so that he fared thrice over the wide sea by his own means, then was he thenceforth of thegn-right worthy." [6] In a similar manner a successful thegn might hope to become an [earl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl "Earl"). In addition to the thegns there were others who were thegns on account of their birth, and thus thegnhood was partly inherited and partly acquired.

## Thegns and local administration

The twelve senior thegns of the [hundred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_(division) "Hundred (division)") play a part, the nature of which is rather doubtful, in the development of the English system of justice. By a law of [Aethelred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethelred_the_Unready "Ethelred the Unready") they "seem to have acted as the judicial committee of the court for the purposes of accusation," [7] and thus they have some connection with the [grand jury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury "Grand jury") of modern times.

## Growing class

The increase in the number of thegns produced in time a subdivision of the order. There arose a class of king's thegns, corresponding to the earlier thegns, and a larger class of inferior thegns, some of them the thegns of bishops or of other thegns. A king's thegn was a person of great importance, the contemporary idea being shown by the Latin translation of the words as _comes_ (compare " [count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count "Count")"). He had certain special privileges. No one save the king had the right of jurisdiction over him, while by a law of [Canute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canute "Canute") we learn that he paid a larger [heriot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heriot "Heriot") than an ordinary thegn.

## After the Conquest

### _Taini_ in Domesday Book

In [Domesday Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book "Domesday Book"), OE _þegn_ has become _tainus_ in the [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") form, but the word does not imply high status. _Domesday Book_ lists the _taini_ who hold lands directly from the king at the end of their respective counties, but the term became devalued, partly because there were so many thegns.

## Analogies

Compare the separate development of the concept of " [vassal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal "Vassal")", from a warlord's [henchman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henchman "Henchman") to one of [Charlemagne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne")'s great companions.

## Runestones

During the later part of the 10th and in the 11th centuries, it became common for families or comrades to raise memorial runestones, and approximately fifty of these note that the deceased was a thegn. Examples of such runestones include [Sö 170](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece_runestones#S.C3.B6_170 "Greece runestones") at Nälberga, [Vg 59](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norra_H%C3%A4rene_Runestone "Norra Härene Runestone") at Norra Härene, [Vg 150](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velanda_Runestone "Velanda Runestone") at Velanda, [DR 143](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunderup_Runestone "Gunderup Runestone") at Gunderup, [DR 209](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glavendrup_stone "Glavendrup stone") at Glavendrup, and [DR 277](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydsg%C3%A5rd_Runestone "Rydsgård Runestone") at Rydsgård.
