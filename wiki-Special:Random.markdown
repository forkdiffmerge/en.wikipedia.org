**Velcro dog** is a slang term among dog fanciers referring to a dog that either displays [separation anxiety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_anxiety_in_dogs "Separation anxiety in dogs") or otherwise strongly prefers to be near its owner. [1] The term plays on the clinging ability of the [Velcro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velcro "Velcro") hook-and-loop fastener.

Dog Separation anxiety manifests itself in destructive behaviors occurring when the dog is left alone. Some of these behaviors are chewing, digging, pawing at doors or windows, barking, howling and even urinating and defecating. The behaviors generally happen within the first 15 to 30 minutes after the departure of the last person but tend to cease after the 45-minute mark. It is important to note here that a dog with separation anxiety is not doing these behaviors to exact revenge on his owners for leaving. The dog is truly in a state of panic and fear and is simply responding to those feelings. [2]
