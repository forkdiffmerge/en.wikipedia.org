The **Bishop of Exeter** is the [Ordinary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_(officer) "Ordinary (officer)") of the [Church of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England "Church of England") [Diocese of Exeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Exeter "Diocese of Exeter") in the [Province of Canterbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Canterbury "Province of Canterbury") . [1] The incumbent signs his name as his Christian name or forename followed by _ [Exon.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoniensis "Exoniensis") _, abbreviated from the Latin _Episcopus Exoniensis_ ("Bishop of Exeter").

From the first [bishop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop "Bishop") until the sixteenth century the Bishops of [Exeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter "Exeter") were in [full communion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_communion "Full communion") with the [Roman Catholic Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church") . However during the [Reformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation "English Reformation") the church in England broke away from the authority of the [Pope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope "Pope") and the Roman Catholic Church, at first temporarily and later more permanently. Since the Reformation, the Bishop and Diocese of Exeter has been part of the [Church of England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England "Church of England") and of the [Anglican Communion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Communion "Anglican Communion") .

The current bishop is the [Right Reverend Dr. Michael Langrish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Langrish "Michael Langrish") , the **Lord Bishop of Exeter**, who signs _Michael Exon_.

## [ [edit](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bishop_of_Exeter&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History") ] History

The history of Christianity in the South West of [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England "England") remains to some degree obscure. At a certain point the historical county of Devon formed part of the diocese of Wessex. About 703 Devon and Cornwall were included in the separate [Diocese of Sherborne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Sherborne "Diocese of Sherborne") and in 900 this was again divided, the Devon bishop having from 905 his seat at Tawton (now [Bishop's Tawton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop%27s_Tawton "Bishop's Tawton") ) and from 912 at [Crediton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crediton "Crediton") , birthplace of St Boniface. [Lyfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyfing,_Abbot_of_Tavistock "Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock") became [Bishop of Crediton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Crediton "Bishop of Crediton") in 1027 and shortly afterwards became [Bishop of Cornwall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Cornwall "Bishop of Cornwall") .

The two dioceses of Crediton and Cornwall, covering Devon and Cornwall, were permanently united under [Edward the Confessor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor "Edward the Confessor") by [Lyfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyfing,_Abbot_of_Tavistock "Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock") 's successor [Bishop Leofric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leofric_(bishop) "Leofric (bishop)") , hitherto Bishop of Crediton, who became first Bishop of Exeter under [Edward the Confessor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_the_Confessor "Edward the Confessor") , which was established as his cathedral city in 1050. At first the abbey church of St Mary and St Peter, founded by Athelstan in 932 and rebuilt in 1019, served as the cathedral.

### [ [edit](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bishop_of_Exeter&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Cathedral") ] Cathedral

Main article: [Exeter Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Cathedral "Exeter Cathedral")

The present cathedral was begun by Bishop [William de Warelhurst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_de_Warelhurst "William de Warelhurst") in 1112, the transept towers he built being the only surviving part of the Norman building, which was completed by Bishop Marshall at the close of the twelfth century. The cathedral is dedicated to St Peter.

As it now stands, the cathedral is in the decorated style. It was begun by Bishop [Quinel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Quinel "Peter Quinel") (1280â€“1291), continued by Bishops Bytton and Stapeldon, and completed, much as it has since remained, by [Bishop Grandisson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grandisson "John Grandisson") during his long pontificate of 42 years.

In many respects Exeter cathedral resembles those of France rather than others found in England. Its special features are the transept towers and the choir, containing much early stained glass. There is also an [episcopal throne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_throne "Episcopal throne") , separated from the nave by a [choir screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir_screen "Choir screen") (1324) and a stately West front. In a comparison with certain other English cathedrals, it is perhaps disadvantaged by the absence of a central tower and a general lack of elevation, but it is undoubtedly very fine.

### [ [edit](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bishop_of_Exeter&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Organization") ] Organization

The bishops of Exeter, like the general population of the diocese, always enjoyed considerable independence, and the see was one of the largest and richest in England. The remoteness of the see from London prevented it from being bestowed on statesmen or courtiers, so that over the centuries the roll of bishops possessed more capable scholars and administrators than in many other sees. The result was a long and stable line of bishops, leading to active Christian observance in the area.

The diocese contained 604 parishes grouped in four archdeaconries: [Cornwall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Cornwall "Archdeacon of Cornwall") , [Barnstaple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Barnstaple "Archdeacon of Barnstaple") , [Exeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Archdeacons_of_Exeter "List of Archdeacons of Exeter") , and [Totnes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Totnes "Archdeacon of Totnes") . There were Benedictine, Augustinian, Premonstratensian, Franciscan and Dominican [religious houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monastic_houses_in_Devon "List of monastic houses in Devon") , and four [Cistercian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians "Cistercians") abbeys.

### [ [edit](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bishop_of_Exeter&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Modern history") ] Modern history

This wealthy diocese was forced to cede land during the reign of Henry VIII, when Bishop Vesey was obliged to surrender fourteen out of twenty-two manors, and the value of the see was reduced to a third of what it formerly was. Vesey, despite his Catholic sympathies, held the see until 1551, when he finally had to resign, and was replaced by the Bible translator [Miles Coverdale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Coverdale "Miles Coverdale") . Following the accession of Mary, in 1553, Vesey was restored, but died soon after in 1554. He was succeeded by [James Turberville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Turberville "James Turberville") , the last Catholic Bishop of Exeter. Turberville was removed from the see by the Protestant [Elizabeth I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England "Elizabeth I of England") in 1559, and died in prison, probably in or about 1570.

[Henry Phillpotts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Phillpotts "Henry Phillpotts") served as Lord Bishop of Exeter from 1830 to his death in office in 1869. He was England's longest serving bishop since the 14th century. The diocese was divided in 1876 along the border of Devon and Cornwall, creating the [Diocese of Truro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Truro "Diocese of Truro") (but five parishes which were at the time in Devon were included in this diocese as they had always been within the [Archdeaconry of Cornwall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeaconry_of_Cornwall "Archdeaconry of Cornwall") ). The diocese covers the County of [Devon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon "Devon") . The [see](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_see "Episcopal see") is in the [City of Exeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter "Exeter") where the seat is located at the [Cathedral Church of Saint Peter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Cathedral "Exeter Cathedral") which was founded as an abbey possibly before 690. The current incumbent is the Right Reverend Dr ** [Michael Langrish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Langrish "Michael Langrish") **, the **Lord Bishop of Exeter**, who signs _Michael Exon_.
