Assorted forks. From left to right: dessert fork, relish fork, salad fork, dinner fork, cold cuts fork, serving fork, carving fork.

As a piece of [cutlery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutlery "Cutlery") or [kitchenware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchenware "Kitchenware"), a **fork** is a tool consisting of a handle with several narrow [tines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tine_(structural) "Tine (structural)") on one end. The fork as an eating utensil has been a feature primarily of the West, whereas in East Asia [chopsticks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks "Chopsticks") have been more prevalent. Today, forks are increasingly available throughout East Asia. The utensil (usually metal) is used to lift food to the mouth or to hold ingredients in place while cooking or cutting those things. Food can be lifted either by spearing it on the tines, or by holding it on top of the tines, which are often curved slightly. For this former function, in the [American style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigzag_method "Zigzag method") of fork etiquette, the fork is held with tines curving up; however, in [continental style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_utensil_etiquette#European_style "Eating utensil etiquette"), the fork is held with the tines curving down.[_ [citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] A fork is also shaped in the form of a trident but curved at the joint of the handle to the points.

Though the fork's early history is obscure, the fork as a kitchen and dining utensil is generally believed to have originated in the [Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), or perhaps in [Ancient Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"). The personal table fork most likely originated in the [Eastern Roman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"), or _Byzantine_, Empire. Its use spread to what is now the Middle East during the first millennium CE and then spread into southern Europe during the second millennium. It did not become common in northern Europe until the 18th century and was not common in North America until the 19th century.

Bronze forks made in Iran during the 8th or 9th century.

The word _fork_ comes from the Latin _furca_, meaning " [pitchfork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork")." Some of the earliest known uses of forks with food occurred in [Ancient Egypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt "Ancient Egypt") where large forks were used as cooking utensils. [1] Bone forks had been found in the burial site of the [Bronze Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age "Bronze Age") [Qijia culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qijia_culture "Qijia culture") (2400 – 1900 BC) as well as later Chinese dynasties' tombs. [2] The Ancient Greeks used the fork as a serving utensil, [3] and it is also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, in the Book of I Samuel 2:13 ("The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the fresh flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand..."). The Greek name for fork is still used in some European languages, for instance in the [Venetian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_language "Venetian language"), [Greek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") and [Albanian languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language "Albanian language").

In the [Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), [bronze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") and silver forks were used, indeed many examples are displayed in museums around Europe. [4] [5] The use varied according to local customs, social class and the nature of food, but forks of the earlier periods were mostly used as cooking and serving utensils. The personal table fork was most likely invented in the [Eastern Roman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern Roman Empire"), or _Byzantine_, Empire where they were in common use by the 4th century CE (its origin may even go back to [Ancient Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece"), before the Roman period). [6] [7] Records show that by the 9th century a similar utensil known as a _barjyn_ was in limited use in Persia within some elite circles. [8] By the 10th century the table fork was in common use throughout what is now the Middle East and Turkey. [1]

By the 11th century, the table fork had made its way to [Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy "Italy"). In Italy, it became quite popular by the 14th century, being commonly used for eating by merchant and upper classes by 1600. It was proper for a guest to arrive with his own fork and [spoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon "Spoon") enclosed in a box called a _cadena_; this usage was introduced to the French court with [Catherine de' Medici](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_de%27_Medici "Catherine de' Medici")'s entourage. In Portugal, forks began being used with [Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanta_Beatrice,_Duchess_of_Viseu "Infanta Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu"), king [Manuel I of Portugal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_I_of_Portugal "Manuel I of Portugal")'s mother. [9] That happened around 1450. Still forks were not commonly used in Western Europe until the 16th century when they became part of the [etiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette "Etiquette") in Italy. [10] It had also gained some currency in Spain by this time, [11] and its use gradually spread to France. Even at that, though, most of Europe did not adopt use of the fork until the 18th century. [6]

Long after the personal table fork had become commonplace in France, at the supper celebrating the marriage of the [duc de Chartres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_II,_Duke_of_Orl%C3%A9ans "Philippe II, Duke of Orléans") to Louis XIV's natural daughter in 1692, the seating was described in the court memoirs of [Saint-Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Rouvroy,_duc_de_Saint-Simon "Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon"): " [King James](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England "James II of England") having his Queen on his right hand and the [King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France "Louis XIV of France") on his left, and each with their cadenas." In [Perrault](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault "Charles Perrault")'s contemporaneous fairy tale of _ [La Belle au bois dormant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty "Sleeping Beauty")_ (1697), each of the fairies invited for the christening is presented with a splendid "Fork Holder."

The fork's adoption in northern Europe was slower. Its use was first described in English by [Thomas Coryat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Coryat "Thomas Coryat") in a volume of writings on his Italian travels (1611), but for many years it was viewed as an unmanly Italian affectation. Some writers of the Roman Catholic Church expressly disapproved of its use (despite its above-mentioned use in the Bible), seeing it as "excessive delicacy": "God in his wisdom has provided man with natural forks – his fingers. Therefore it is an insult to Him to substitute artificial metallic forks for them when eating." [12] [13] It was not until the 18th century that the fork became commonly used in Great Britain, although some sources say forks were common in France, England and Sweden already by the early 17th century. [14] [15] The fork did not become popular in North America until near the time of the [American Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution"). [1] The curved fork that is used in most parts of the world today, was developed in Germany in the mid 18th century. The standard four-tine design became current in the early 19th century.

The 20th century also saw the emergence of the " [spork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spork "Spork")", a utensil that is half-fork and half-spoon. With this new "fork-spoon", only one piece of cutlery is needed when eating (so long as no knife is required). The back of the [spork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spork "Spork") is shaped like a spoon and can scoop food while the front has shortened tines like a fork. It has found popularity in fast food and military settings.

In 2013, a patented [digital fork](http://www.slowcontrol.com) was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show Las Vegas 2013. The fork vibrates when the recommended eating speed is surpassed. The number of user forkfuls and eating times are recorded and visualized as graphs.  The inventor, Jacques Lepine, is CEO of Slow Control, a French company.

Electric variations of this fork have become more prevalent in modern times.
