**hylOs** - the hypermedia learning Object system is a [Content Management System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_System "Content Management System") for [elearning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elearning "Elearning") material. hylOs allows the authoring, instructional composition and dynamic presentation of eLearning content based on standard objects, i.e., IEEE [LOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Object_Metadata "Learning Object Metadata") eLearning Objects. hylOs is an outcome of the cooperation of [HAW Hamburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAW_Hamburg "HAW Hamburg"), [FHTW Berlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschule_f%C3%BCr_Technik_und_Wirtschaft_Berlin "Fachhochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin") and [link-lab](http://www.link-lab.net).

## History

The prototype of the hylOs system was presented at the international workshop for [blended learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning "Blended learning") in [Villach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villach "Villach") in 2002. hylOs is based on the development of the [Media Information Repository](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Media_Information_Repository&action=edit&redlink=1 "Media Information Repository (page does not exist)") (MIR) in [1999](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999 "1999"), which allows the strict separation of content, structure, logic and appearance based on [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") technology. The company spin-off started 2006.

## Background

Since [hypermedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia "Hypermedia") systems have been introduced to teaching and learning environments, the authoring and use of learning material has undergone a shift in paradigm. Linear instructional designs such as those found in books or scripts are now complemented by interconnected [knowledge networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Knowledge_networks&action=edit&redlink=1 "Knowledge networks (page does not exist)"). Content access no longer follows a single predefined path, but multiple, associative rules driven by individual inquiries.

In the field of _educational content management_ the concept of atomic, self-consistent content units became standardised 2002 as IEEE LOM [eLearning objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object "Learning object") (eLOs). A basis for reusable learning objects was established, however there is no literature demonstrating that reuse actually happens with learning objects. hylOs is one of the first systems, which implements this approach and allows the graphical creation and composition of elearning objects.

Authoring eLearning objects (eLOs) needs the aggregated, self-consistent presentation of a self-contained subject matter in multiple types (slides, long text, animation, etc.) if applicable as well as their decoration with [metadata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") and structures. To relax this comparatively complex process hylOs was developed. hylOs has _one_ editor, which is used to create different kinds of content and metadata. The core component for content creation is an MS-Word-like WYSIWYG XML editor. The hylOs presentation layer operates under an extensive understanding of the eLO semantic: Following the LOM attributes the learner can adapt individually the frontend to complexity levels, contexts, semantic density and other specifications. Various access paths admit the usage of suitable didactic models. In addition presented hyperlinks can be chosen according to freely definable semantic decorated 'link contexts'.
